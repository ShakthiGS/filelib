Through experiments, it can be seen that the PoSA consen-
sus algorithm proposed in this paper has certain advantages
in resource utilization compared with PoW and can obtain a
higher QoS value compared with PBFT. With the improvement
of the hardware, it can have better storage request processing
capacity.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a scalable two-layer blockchain
system for distributed multi-cloud storage in IIoT. First, we

architecture in which the asynchronous consensus group is
proposed to increase ef?ciency and ensure the reliability of
the model. In addition, the design of asynchronous consensus
group makes the model highly scalable. Through theoretical
analysis, we demonstrate the proposed architecture is secure
and ef?cient. Through simulations and experiments, it can be
seen that the proposed architecture can greatly increase the
