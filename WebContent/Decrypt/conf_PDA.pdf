Emulation Testing 
access model for .NET-based applications. It can be used to 
IV RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
access relational database systems, SQL Server 2005, Oracle  
etc. The fig 1.3 shows user login where, the user will enter the 
 user name and password provided by administrator. Fig 1.4 
B. Database Management shows main form having three main Menu. 1) The Search 
option having three subitems i.e. searching with Semester-
SQL Server 2005 used to provide native support for 
wise, Room-wise and, the Complete-Time-Table. 2) Master 
managing XML data, in addition to relational data. SQL 
option having four subitems i.e. Subject, Professor, Room, 
Server 2005 has also been enhanced with new indexing 
Department provides respected information. 3) Report option 
algorithms and better error recovery systems.  
generates reports Subject-wise, Professor-wise and, 
      
Department-wise.

The figure 1.5 displays the list of subjects and its type of a 
      
particular semester as per user’s request. Similarly list of 
      
professors of a particular department can also be checked. 
      
The system requests the user to enter the semester and 
      
department for the result of complete time table of the 
      
semester as shown in fig 1.6. Figure 1.6 displays complete 
      
time table according to user’s request. Similarly the system 
      
provides time table information according to Room No and 
  
Time.

The testing of implemented system is done by emulation by 
 
emulator and than deployment is done on PDA.  
 
An emulator duplicates the functions of the one system using 
a different system, so that the second system behaves like the 
first system. 
Structure of emulator; 
An emulator is divided into modules that correspond roughly 
to the emulated computer’s subsystems. Most often, an 
emulator will be composed of the following modules: 
1) A CPU emulators or CPU simulator. 
2) A memory subsystem module. 
3) Various I/O devices emulators. 
4) Buses are often not emulated, either for reasons of 
performance or simplicity, and virtual peripherals 
communicate directly with the CPU or the memory 
subsystem.
